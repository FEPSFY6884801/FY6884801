    This paper explores the potential advantages of quantum computers in the realm of financial targeting and prediction compared to current computational methods. As financial markets become increasingly more complex, 
    classical algorithms face disadvantages in processing large datasets and identifying the necessary patterns. I will analyse key quantum algorithm such as Grover's and Shor's and how they help to enhance predictive accuracy and targeting
    efficiency. Through comparative study, I will analyse where quantum computing could outperform current technologies, addressing both technical challenges and practical applications. The findings suggest that although quantum computers 
    hold significant promise for further developing financial analytics, its widespread uses are contingent upon overcoming already present hardware and algorithmic limitations. This research aims to identify the strengths and weakness 
    between quantum computing and existing methods and see the potential outcomes for future predictive modelling.

   <hr>
   
   <p class="ex1">
   <pre style="font-family: Calibri;">
    Quantum computers represent an advancement in computational methods, with significant implications in many fields, including finance. Traditional computing methods are found to often struggle to manage the complexity of 
    financial markets, particularly in areas such as targeting and prediction. As <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08812"> Ladd et al. (2010) note </a>, quantum computers utilise the principles of quantum mechanics to 
    process information in ways that traditional algorithms cannot, allowing for better analysis of large data and the identification of intricate patterns. This possibility makes quantum computing a potential changer 
    in financial analytics. In this paper I will explore key quantum algorithms, such as Grover's and Shor's, to illustrate the potential advantages they have over traditional methods particularly pertaining to predictive and targeting 
    efficiency. This would be done through a comparative study. Where I will look through technical challenges and practical applications of quantum computing in finance.

   <p class= "ex1">
   <pre style="font-family: Calibri;">
    <h4 style="font-family: Calibri;">Grover's Algorithim (Figure 1):</h4> 
    Grover's algorithm is designed to search an unsorted database or solving problems with much greater efficiency than classical algorithms  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-01904-7">(Figgatt et al., 2017)</a>.
    It can be used to search through an unstructured database containing N items to find a specific item that satisfies the condition. What makes it stand out to classical algorithms is they tend to require an average of O(N) evaluations 
    to find the key item, but Grover's can do it in O(N^1/2) evaluations. This is a significant quadratic speed up and is possible because it utilises quantum superposition allowing multiple evaluations simultaneously. While it does not 
    directly predict outcomes, in predictive analysis it can identify the most impactful features in datasets used for stock price predictions. It can also be used for algorithmic trading or 
    HFT (high frequency trading) as it can enhance trading strategies by quickly searching for the best trading signals
    
    <h4 style="font-family: Calibri;">Shor's Algorithim (Figure 2):</h4>
    Shor's algorithm is designed for integer factorisation, which is the process of decomposing a composite number into its prime factors. This specific algorithm has significant implications for systems that rely on the difficulty 
    of factoring large numbers. The general number field sieve, which is a classical algorithm for factorising, operates in exponential time whereas Shor's can factor in polynomial time (O((LogN)^3))). Not only does it use superposition 
    and entanglement, allowing multiple possibilities to be explored simultaneously but it also uses quantum Fourier transform. Which is used to analyse the frequency components of a signal. 
    These both make it faster and more efficient to classical algorithms  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aad9480">(Monz et al., 2016)</a>.

    Grover's and Shor's algorithms offer promising advantages in targeting and prediction within financial markets because of their quantum properties, which gives them quadratic and exponential speed 
    ups compared to classical algorithms  <a href=" https://doi.org/10.12928/telkomnika.v18i3.14755">(Wicaksana, A., Anthony, A., & Wicaksono, A. W. (2020))</a>.Grover's algorithm achieves quadratic speedup by using quantum superposition and amplitude amplification, allowing it 
    to search unsorted databases in O(SQRT(N)) time, compared to the classical O(N). Shor's algorithm achieves exponential speedup by using quantum parallelism and the quantum Fourier transform to factor large numbers in polynomial 
    time O ((log N) ^3), compared to the exponential time of classical methods It is also presented with challenges of their own. One of the biggest challenges that Groverâ€™s algorithm has is that it is limited by the current quantum 
    hardware limitations as quantum computing is a recently new field of computing with a lot of nuances to be had. Another disadvantage it could run into is the integration within classical systems as most current institutions 
    rely on these classical systems. Also, as dataset of financial markets grow Groverâ€™s algorithm might not always be a practical advantage if the data is not structured correctly. Shorâ€™s algorithm similar disadvantages to Groverâ€™s but it 
    also has specificity issues. Particularly in targeting and prediction. The algorithm is primarily focused on factoring making its utility within financial context more limited and specific compared to Groverâ€™s. Furthermore, one of Shorâ€™s 
    strengths for efficiently tackling large factoring efficiently poses as a huge threat to already existing cryptographic methods leading to massive security risks and greater need for financial institution to implement new cryptographic methods.

    <pre style="font-family: Calibri;">
     Both algorithms have great potential for the improvement of targeting and predication within the financial sector.However, in the industries current state, there are major challenges that need to be resolved such as limitations of 
     quantum technology, data management and integration with existing systems. With ongoing advancements in quantum computing being necessary to overcome these challenges to be able to fully utilise both these algorithms to their full capabilities.
