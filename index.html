      This paper explores the potential adavantages of quantum computers in the realm of financial targetting and prediction
      compared to cuurent computational methods. As financial markets become increasingly more complex, classical algorithims 
      face disadvantages in processing large datasets and indentifying the necessary patterns. I will analyse key quantum algorithims
      such as Grover's and Shor's and how they help to enchance predictive accuracy and targeting efficiency. Through comparative 
      study, I will analyse where quantum computing could outperform current technologies, addressing both technical challenges and
      practical applications. The findings suggest that alothough quantum computers hold significant promise for further devloping 
      financial analystics, its widespread uses are contigent upon overcoming already present hardware and algorithimic limitations.
      This reaseach aims to identify the strengths and weakness between quatum computing and existing methods and also see the potential
      outcomes for future predictive modeling.

       Quantum computers represent an advancement in computational methods, with  sigificant implications in many fields, including finance.
       Traditional computing methods are found to often stuggle to manage the complexity of financial markets, particularly in areas such as 
       targetting and prediction.
