      This paper explores the potential adavantages of quantum computers in the realm of financial targetting and prediction
      compared to cuurent computational methods. As financial markets become increasingly more complex, classical algorithims 
      face disadvantages in processing large datasets and indentifying the necessary patterns. I will analyse key quantum algorithims
      such as Grover's and Shor's and how they help to enchance predictive accuracy and targeting efficiency. Through comparative 
      study, I will analyse where quantum computing could outperform current technologies, addressing both technical challenges and
      practical applications. The findings suggest that alothough quantum computers hold significant promise for further devloping 
      financial analystics, its widespread uses are contigent upon overcoming already present hardware and algorithimic limitations.
      This reaseach aims to identify the strengths and weakness between quatum computing and existing methods and also see the potential
      outcomes for future predictive modeling.

       Quantum computers represent an advancement in computational methods, with  sigificant implications in many fields, including finance.
       Traditional computing methods are found to often stuggle to manage the complexity of financial markets, particularly in areas such as 
       targetting and prediction. As <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08812"> Ladd et al. (2010) note </a>, quantum computers utilise the principles
       of quantum mechanics to process information in ways that traditional alogrithims cannot, allowing for better analysis of large data and the 
       identification of intricate patterns. This possibility makes quantum computing a potential changer in financial analystics. In this paper 
       I will explore key quantum algorithims, such as Grover's and Shor's, to illustrate the potential advantages they have over traditional methods
       particularly pertaining to predicitve and targetting efficiency. This would be done through a comparative study. Where I will look through
       technicla challenges and practical applications of quantum computing in finance.

     <!-- ADD GRAPHS HERE -->
     <pre>
     <h4 style="font-family: Calibri;">Grover's Algorithim</h4> 
      Grover's alogrithim is designed to search an unsorted database or solving problems with much greater efficiency than classical algorithims <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-01904-7">(Figgatt et al., 2017)</a>.
      It can be used to search through an unstructred database containing N items to find a specific item that satisfies the condition. What makes it stand out to 
      classical alogorithims is they tend to require an average of O(N) evaluations to find the key item but Grover's can do it in O(N^1/2) evaluations. This 
      is a significant quadratci speed up and is possible because it utilises quantum superposition allowing multiple evalutions simulataneously. While it does
      not directly predict outcomes, in predicitve analysis it can identify the most impactful features in datasets used for stock price predictions. It can
      also be used for alogorthimic trading or HFT (high frequency trading) as it cna ehance trading strategies by quickly searching for the best trading signals.

     <h4 style="font-family: Calibri;">Shor's Algorithim</h4>
      Shor's alogorithim is designed for integer facorisation, which is the process of decompsoing a composite number into its prime factors. This specific 
      alogrithim has significant implications for systems that rely on teh difficulty of ffactoring large numbers. The genral number field sieve, which is a
      classical algorithim for factorising, operates in exponential time whereas Shor's can factoring is polynominal time (O((LogN)^3))). Not only does it use 
      superposition and entanglemt, allowing multiple possibilites to be explored simulataneously but it also uses quantum fourier transform. Which is used to 
      analyse the frequency components of a signal. These both make it faster and more efficient to classical alogrithims <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aad9480">(Monz et al., 2016)</a>.

      Grover's and Shor's algorithms offer promising advantages in targeting and prediction within financial markets because of their quantum properties, 
      which gives them quadratic and exponential speed ups compared to classical algorithms <a href=" https://doi.org/10.12928/telkomnika.v18i3.14755">(Wicaksana, A., Anthony, A., & Wicaksono, A. W. (2020))</a>.
      Grover's algorithm achieves quadratic speedup by using quantum superposition and amplitude amplification, allowing it to search unsorted databases in O(SQRT(N)) time, compared to the classical O(N).
      Shor's algorithm achieves exponential speedup by using quantum parallelism and the quantum Fourier transform to factor large numbers in polynomial time O ((log N) ^3), compared to the exponential time of classical methods
      It is also presented with challenges of their own.One of the biggest challenges that Grover’s algorithm has is that it is limited by the current quantum hardware limitations as quantum computing is a recently 
      new field of computing with a lot of nuances to be had. Another disadvantage it could run into is the integration within classical systems as most current institutions 
      rely on these classical systems. Also, as dataset of financial markets grow Grover’s algorithm might not always be a practical advantage if the data is not structured correctly. 
      Shor’s algorithm similar disadvantages to Grover’s but it also has specificity issues. Particularly in targeting and prediction. The algorithm is primarily focused 
      on factoring making its utility within financial context more limited and specific compared to Grover’s. Furthermore, one of Shor’s strengths for efficiently 
      tackling large factoring efficiently poses as a huge threat to already existing cryptographic methods leading to massive security risks and greater need for financial 
      institution to implement new cryptographic methods. (Graph in excel)

      Both algorithms have great potential for the improvement of targeting and predication within the financial sector. However, in the industries current state, there are 
      major challenges that need to be resolved such as limitations of quantum technology, data management and integration with existing systems. With ongoing advancements in quantum 
      computing being necessary to overcome these challenges to be able to fully utilise both these algorithms to their full capabilities
